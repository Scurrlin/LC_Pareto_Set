# Stacks

# A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which
# the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or
# FILO (First In Last Out).

stack = []
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack)  # Output: [1, 2]
